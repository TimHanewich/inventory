# 5V, 200 mA Solar Panels
I purchased [a 5 pack of these small 5V solar panels](https://a.co/d/aCdt4tS).

## Performance
According to [this review](https://i.imgur.com/L4ejdIv.png), they get:
- 118.6 mA with no load
- 52.8 mA with 100 ohm load (resistor)
- 99.6 mA with 47 ohm load (resistor)

## Performance: An Old Unit
I had a very old unit that had spent about a full year in the Florida sun. The performance was very poor. Performance below was measured in **direct sunlight** in the summertime in Florida:
- 5.9 volts
- 16 mA of current passing through multimeter hooked up to a LM2596
