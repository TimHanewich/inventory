# 5V, 200 mA Solar Panels
I purchased [a 5 pack of these small 5V solar panels](https://a.co/d/aCdt4tS).

## Performance: An Old Unit
I had a very old unit that had spent about a full year in the Florida sun. The performance was very poor. Performance below was measured in **direct sunlight** in the summertime in Florida:
- 5.9 volts
- 16 mA of current passing through multimeter hooked up to a LM2596
