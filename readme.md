# Tim's Inventory
I buy, test, and use a *a lot* of various electronic components, hardware, microcontrollers, batteries, 3D-printing supplies, and more in many of my projects. In an effort to catalog what I've used and my thoughts on some of them, I've made this repo to track my inventory, what I've had success with, and what I haven't!
